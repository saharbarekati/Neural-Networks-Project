## speech emotion detection with RNN 

- file: "speechEmotion.ipynb"

I worked by emotions detection from the sound so that it receives a sound as input, and then you have to classify which class of emotions this sound belongs to

## traffic signs

- file: "trafficSigns.ipynb"

I detected traffic signs by CNN. A data set consisting of 140 images in  32 * 32 pixels of traffic signs is presented. Each image has a label that also has a description of the tags.

## fraud detection

- file: "fraud.ipynb"

This data set consists of financial transaction information that used AutoEncoder model to detect the if a transaction is fraud or not . The isFraud column indicates whether the transaction is fraud or not.

## House price detection 

 file: "HousePriceDetection.ipynb"

The data set consists of 154,424 images of houses, some of them features and prices are also identified. I predicted the price of a house based on available data and their image by CNN."# Neural-Networks-Project"
